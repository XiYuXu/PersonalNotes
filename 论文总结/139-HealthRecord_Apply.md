## 写作目的

> 现有的Electronic health record (EHR)面临很多不安全因素，而面向医疗的区块链存储解决方案可以提供分布式、匿名性、安全的EHR管理系统

## 所用技术

- fabric
- Identity Mixer (Idemix)  ：With Idemix, a client acting
  as a blockchain participant may read, update or share private medical records while preserving their
  anonymity and privacy
- proof-of-concept implementation

## 系统作用

can be used by patients or other healthcare actors that wish to store health records in an immutable distributed ledger that ensures data privacy，This immutable ledger protects data against misuses and abuses，③whilst allowing
the querying of non-personal data by authorized blockchain participants④upports secure auditing, preservation of the privacy
of accumulated personal data and isolates data related to auditing and compliance checks

## 现实意义

The proposed solution is able to store patient records effectively whilst providing anonymity and unlinkability
